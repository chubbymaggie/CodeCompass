\section userguide_metrics Metrics
Code metrics is an analysing tool. It helps to identify the complexity of our code. 
We can access it by right clicking on a directory/file at the filemanager.

\subsection userguide_metrics_settings Settings
Here we can set file type filter (the default is all), size and color
dimension of diagram.

\subsection userguide_metrics_diagram Diagram
Metrics diagram shows directories/files in rectangles. The fill color goes from 
light green to blue. If it's light green than color dimension is zero, else color 
is representing the setted color dimension size(Original Lines Of Code etc.).
The size of a rectangle also has a meaning: the bigger a rectangle is, the
larger of it's selected metric is.
